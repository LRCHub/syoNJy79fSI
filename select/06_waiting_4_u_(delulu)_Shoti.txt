I'll be waiting for you
I don't know what to do
Should I wait for you
Is your love even true
Stuck inside this loop
I feel like I can wait awhile
Don't worry baby take your time
Even if you take a lifetime
I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you
Hoping that the stars align
I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you
Wala ko kasabot
Unsa imong gi pa abot
Uyab ba ta
Or dili ba
Kay akong ulo ga libog
Pero
Ikaw akong tanan
Nutella sa akoang pan
Dili para sa tanan
Ikaw raman
Ikaw raman
I only seem to feel
Love when it's with you
Can't imagine seeing you
With someone else
Feels like hell
I feel like I can wait a while
Don't worry baby take your time
Even if you take a lifetime
I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you
Hoping that the stars align
I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you
Even if you take a lifetime
I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you
Hoping that the stars align
I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you
